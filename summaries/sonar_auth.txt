A type of authentication system for wearable (watch) devices
Used a multi model deep learning classifier for user authentication using a single thumb tap. 

Basically capture data regarding the thumb using the speaker to send signal then receive signal using the microphone. 
Signal analysis and use a neural network model to train the data set.
Created a watchOS app without modifying the watch but using existing sensors from factory-made watch.
