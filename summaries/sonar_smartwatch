Using Sonar to Identify Fingers on a Smartwatch
https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3501935

- Collected data for each finger and trained a Neural Network model to predict which touch corresponded to which part of the finger.

Trade-off between accuracy of identification of fingerprint and the need to wear additional equipment (like the magnetic ring). 

Have applications such as using different fingers to type a message or have each finger represent a unique/distinct function. Useful as smartwatches have small screens which leads to the fat finger phenomena during the HCI process.
